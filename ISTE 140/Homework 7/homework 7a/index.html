		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>Hi, my name is Michael Pacholarz. I am a second year student here at RIT. My major is CIT. I swim for RIT and enjoy 
            playing video games with my friends in my spare time when I am not either swimming or doing school work. 
            This summer I am taking, three other classes along with this one, swimming for my club team at home, 
            and working as a lifeguard.</p>
            <br/>
		<p>I took this course because it is needed for my major. I figured to take it this summer becasue it will be easier for me 
            to focus on other classes during the fall. I have some previous knowledge about coding in HTML and CSS and general website
            building becasue I took a basic class in highschool. I hope that through this course I will learn more about how websites 
            are made and how they work, and why so. In the long run, I hope this will lead me to a succesful career and a good 
            understanding of how websites are designed and work in general.</p>
